This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in JavaScript within an HTML context: attempting to access and modify a DOM element that hasn't been defined or rendered.  The `bug.html` file shows the erroneous code, resulting in a `TypeError: Cannot set property 'innerHTML' of null`. The `bugSolution.html` provides a corrected version that first checks for the element's existence before attempting to manipulate its innerHTML.
